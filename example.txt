When commiting changes to a repo, you want to follow these steps:

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull
<resolve potential merge conflicts>
git push

Because of differences between commits, we will run into a merge conflict!
It is worth noting, some merge conflicts can be resolved automatically, but
not this one!
Some merge conflicts will need to be resolved manually
Visual Studio Code provides tools that are fairly intuitive
when resolving merge conflicts
